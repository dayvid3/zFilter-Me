This custom filter list is main a collection of rules to block my own cosmetic pet peeves.  It's only public, so that I can use the link.  I wouldn't recommend adding this to your collection of active filters.  It would just add more overhead with some obscure cosmetic filtering that would be irrelevant to your needs.

That said.  Feel free to copy any rules that you find useful for your own custom filter list.
