## Notice:

*Note to self: This list should be added as a Tracking source.  For some reason, it's not as effective when it's added as an Ad Blocking source.

This custom filter list is mainly a collection of rules to block my own cosmetic pet peeves.  It's only public so I can use the link.  I wouldn't recommend adding this to your collection of active filters.  It would mostly just add more overhead with some obscure cosmetic filtering that would be irrelevant to your needs.

That said.  Feel free to copy any rules that you find useful for your own custom filter list.

If you want to see my recommendations of filter lists to use (Vivaldi users especially, but useful for many ad blockers), you can check my [Vivaldi-Tracker_Ad_Blocking_Lists-Customized](https://github.com/dayvid3/Vivaldi-Tracker_Ad_Blocking_Lists-Customized) repo.
